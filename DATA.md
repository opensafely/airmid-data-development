# Data

## Terminology

Participants answer questions in questionnaires.
Their answers are responses.
We expect one questionnaire to be administered once, on day 0:

1. Baseline questionnaire

We expect five questionnaires to be administered four times, on days 0, 30, 60, and 90:

1. Covid and vaccination questionnaire
1. Eq-5D questionnaire
1. Productivity questionnaire
1. Fatigue questionnaire
1. Breathing problems questionnaire

A survey comprises the responses to the questions in between five and six questionnaires on one day.
There are four days, so we expect each participant to take part in four surveys.
